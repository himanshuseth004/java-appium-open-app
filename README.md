# How to close/open the app during a session in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java-openApp) using the Appium Java Language

While performing automation testing with Appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where you'd want to close the application or open the application during a test run.
This can be essential sometimes to see how your application behaves in different scenarios. Let's see how we can leverage Appium's commands to achieve it on LambdaTest.

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.
- Alternatively you can also use the `Custom ID` that you defined in your own words.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Java test on LambdaTest.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```java
public class vanilla_android {
    public static String userName = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME") == null ? "LT_USERNAME"  //Add username here
            : System.getenv("LT_USERNAME");
    public static String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") == null ? "LT_ACCESS_KEY" //Add accessKey here
            : System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY");

    private static AppiumDriver driver;

    public static void main(String args[]) throws MalformedURLException, InterruptedException {

        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "Galaxy S20");
            capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "11");
            capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
            capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("app", "ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"); //Enter App_ID or Customer ID here
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceOrientation", "PORTRAIT");
            capabilities.setCapability("build", "Java Vanilla - iOS");
            capabilities.setCapability("name", "Sample Test Java");
            capabilities.setCapability("console", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("network", false);
            capabilities.setCapability("visual", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("devicelog", true);

            driver = new AppiumDriver(new URL("https://" +userName + ":" + accessKey + "@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"), capabilities);

            MobileElement color = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color"));
            color.click();

            MobileElement text = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text"));
            text.click();

            //Close the application
            driver.closeApp();

            //Open the application
            driver.launchApp();

            MobileElement toast = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast"));
            toast.click();

            MobileElement notification = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification"));
            notification.click();


        } catch (AssertionError a) {
            ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
            a.printStackTrace();
        }
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

* [Close App | Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/commands/device/app/close-app/)

## Executing The Test

Execute the following commands to install the required dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command:

Android:


```bash
mvn test -P android
```

iOS:

```bash
mvn test -P ios
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
